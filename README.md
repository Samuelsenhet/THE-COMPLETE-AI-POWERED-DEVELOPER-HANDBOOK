PART 1: AI DEVELOPMENT COMMAND CENTER
QUICK START - Tell Me What You Need
Just say:
"I'm starting a new project" → I'll guide you through TCRIE
"My prompts aren't working" → I'll walk you through RSTI
"Help me debug [error]" → I'll diagnose and fix
"Create a PRD for [idea]" → I'll build it with you
"What tech stack for [project]?" → I'll recommend options
"I'm stuck on [problem]" → I'll help you solve it

1.1 CORE FRAMEWORKS
TCRIE Framework
Mnemonic: Tiny Crabs Ride Enormous Iguanas
T → Task: Define exactly what needs to be done
C → Context: Provide background, constraints, environment
R → Resources: List available tools, frameworks, documentation
I → Iterate: Build, test, refine in cycles
E → Evaluate: Assess results against objectives

→ Ask me: "Apply TCRIE to [your project]"
RSTI Method

Mnemonic: Ramen Saves Tragic Idiots
R → Revisit: the previous mnemonic/framework
S → Separate: into shorter, clearer sentences
T → Try: different phrasing and approaches
I → Introduce: constraints to focus the response

→ Ask me: "My prompt isn't working: [paste your prompt]"

1.2 THE THINKING FRAMEWORK
Four Levels of Thinking

Level 1: Logical (What is?)
Define the problem space
Understand requirements

Level 2: Analytical (How do I?)
Break down components
Identify resources

Level 3: Computational (How to fit logic?)
Structure the solution
Design architecture

Level 4: Procedural (How do I excel?)
Optimize implementation
Refine and perfect

→ Ask me: "Help me think through [my project] using all 4 levels"

1.3 LEARNING FRAMEWORK: 5-STEP MASTERY METHOD
A structured framework for learning new technologies or building projects effectively.
Mnemonic: GRPCI (Goal, Research, Priming, Comprehension, Implementation)

Time Allocation:
Goal → 5%
Research → 10%
Priming → 2–5%
Comprehension → 60%
Implementation → 20–40%

Step 1: Goal
Define the final objective. What should the project or knowledge result in?
Example: "Build a fullstack app with React, Node.js and PostgreSQL"
AI Help: "Help me define the end goal for [my project]"

Step 2: Research
Identify resources, frameworks, documentation and tools needed.
Include: Tutorials, official docs, courses, community resources
AI Help: "What are the best resources to learn [technology]?"

Step 3: Priming
Prepare subconscious learning by overviewing material before deep learning.
Method: Skim documentation, watch video overviews, browse code examples
Effect: Increases learning speed by 10–20%

Step 4: Comprehension
Gradually increase understanding through structured thinking:
Overview – what are the main concepts?
General concepts – understand the big picture
Major concepts – go deeper into each module
Full examples – see how everything connects
AI Help: "Explain [concept] from beginner to advanced"

Step 5: Implementation
Put everything together by:
Building small modules
Integrating them into a whole
Testing and iterating
AI Help: "Guide me through building [feature] step-by-step"
WHERE AI EXCELS

Research: Quick resource identification
Comprehension: Explains concepts on multiple levels
Implementation: Step-by-step guides, debugging, code generation
Agentic AI: Can create detailed plans in a notebook before coding begins

→ Ask me: "Apply the GRPCI framework to [my project]"

1.4 PRD CREATION PROMPT
Template:
Help me make a PRD for an MVP project/app I'm looking to build.
We should think through the following questions:
What is the project/app?
How do I use the project/app?
What are the patterns behind the project/app?
How do I make the project/app most useful for the target audience?
I've also attached an example PRD that is well fleshed out as guidance.

→ Ask me: "Create a PRD for my [project description]"

===== Page 3 =====

1.5 START SMALL STRATEGY
Development Approach

Identify minimum features for functionality
Implement core functionality first
Iterate and add features incrementally
Score progress: "Could you include score out of 100"

→ Ask me: "Help me identify MVP features for [my app idea]"

1.6 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION PROMPTS
Framework Discovery
"I'm trying to build this project/app. What are the common frameworks for building something like this?"
Understanding Structure
"Could you help me come up with some React frameworks to implement drag and drop into this application and then implement it."

→ Ask me: "What frameworks should I use for [project type]?"

1.7 RECOMMENDED TECH STACK
Frontend

===== Page 4 =====
1.8 VERSION CONTROL & DEBUGGING

Git Commands Reference
git init # Initialize repository
git status # Check status
git add [file] # Add specific file
git add . # Add all changes
git commit -m "message" # Commit changes
git log # View history
git reset [commit] # Roll back
git remote add origin [url] # Add remote
git branch -M main # Rename branch
git push -u origin main # Push to GitHub

AI Git Assistant Prompt
"Use git to commit these changes, push it to GitHub on this branch, roll back the previous version, merge everything together."

→ Ask me: "Help me with git: [describe your situation]"

1.9 DEBUGGING METHODOLOGY
Step-by-Step Process
Problem Identification
○ Where is the problem?
○ What is the problem?
Solution Testing
○ Apply different fixes
○ Test incrementally
AI Assistance
○ Screenshot errors → Send to AI
○ Copy-paste error messages
○ Let AI diagnose and fix

→ Ask me: "Debug this error: [paste error message]"

===== Page 5 =====

1.10 CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION
Detailed Context Checklist
✔ Project details and objectives
✔ Development environment
✔ Personal preferences
✔ Current errors or blockers
✔ Mockups or visual references
✔ Additional data or constraints

→ Ask me: "Help me build a detailed context prompt for [my project]"

Example: Game Development Prompt

HELP ME MAKE A PRD FOR AN MVP APP I'M LOOKING TO BUILD.
I'M LOOKING FOR A GAMIFIED, PIXEL-ART APP WHERE USERS SET DAILY GOALS AND EARN XP FOR COMPLETING THEM. IF THEY SLACK, THEIR AI RIVAL GAINS XP. INSPIRED BY PIXEL ART GAMES LIKE BED FROM POKEMON.
USER SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE TO CUSTOMIZE THE AI RIVAL AND TASKS THAT USER WOULD DO LIKE STUDYING CALCULUS FOR 50 MIN, DRINK 8 GLASSES OF WATER, EXERCISE FOR 1HR.

WE SHOULD THINK THROUGH:
WHAT IS THE GAME?
HOW DO I PLAY THE GAME?
WHAT ARE THE PATTERNS BEHIND THE GAME?
HOW DO I EXCEL AT THE GAME?

→ Ask me: "Adapt this game prompt for my idea: [describe your concept]"
